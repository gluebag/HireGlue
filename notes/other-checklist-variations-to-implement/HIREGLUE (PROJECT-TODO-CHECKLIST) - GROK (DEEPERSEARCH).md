These rules will be implemented in the generation logic, categorized for resumes and cover letters, ensuring compliance through OpenAI prompts and validation.

##### Researching Best Practices

Research extends to the OpenAI API and PHP SDK, focusing on assistants, threads, and tool calls for context-aware generation. The SDK documentation ([OpenAI PHP SDK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai-php/client/refs/heads/main/README.md)) suggests creating custom assistants with instructions incorporating rules, using threads for context, and leveraging embeddings for better content alignment. For Laravel Nova, the documentation ([Laravel Nova Docs](https://nova.laravel.com/docs)) guides setting up resources and authentication, essential for a user-friendly interface.

#### Setting Up the Project: Technical Foundation

Given the project's timeline (1-2 days), we prioritize a fast yet functional setup, starting with Laravel 12 installation and Nova integration.

##### Installing Laravel and Authentication

Install Laravel 12 with:

bash

CollapseWrapCopy

`composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel HireGlue`

Set up authentication using Laravel Breeze, ensuring user management:

bash

CollapseWrapCopy

`composer require laravel/breeze --dev php artisan breeze:install npm install && npm run dev php artisan migrate`

This provides a basic authentication system, crucial for Nova.

##### Installing Laravel Nova

Nova, a paid product, requires a license. Assuming it's acquired, install via:

bash

CollapseWrapCopy

`composer require laravel/nova php artisan nova:install`

Configure Nova, ensuring authentication is linked, and run migrations for Nova tables.

##### Database Configuration

Configure the database in .env, e.g.:

text

CollapseWrapCopy

`DB_CONNECTION=mysql DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 DB_PORT=3306 DB_DATABASE=hireglue DB_USERNAME=root DB_PASSWORD=`

Run initial migrations:

bash

CollapseWrapCopy

`php artisan migrate`

#### Database Migrations: Structuring Data

Migrations define the schema for core models, ensuring data integrity and relationships.

##### JobPost Migration

Create and define:

```php
Schema::create('job_posts', function (Blueprint $table) { $table->id(); $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade'); $table->string('company_name'); $table->string('job_title'); $table->text('job_description'); $table->string('job_post_url')->nullable(); $table->date('job_post_created_date')->nullable(); $table->timestamps(); });
```
Run with php artisan migrate.

##### Resume and CoverLetter Migrations

Similarly, for resumes:

```php
Schema::create('resumes', function (Blueprint $table) { $table->id(); $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade'); $table->foreignId('job_post_id')->constrained()->onDelete('cascade'); $table->string('file_path'); $table->timestamps(); });
```
And cover letters, mirroring the structure. Store content as files for performance, with paths in the database.

#### Nova Resources: User Interface

Nova resources provide a graphical interface for data management, essential for user interaction.

##### User Resource

Create with:

bash

CollapseWrapCopy

`php artisan nova:resource User`

Define fields in app/Nova/User.php, e.g.:

php

CollapseWrapCopy

`public function fields(Request $request) { return [ ID::make()->sortable(), Text::make('Name'), Text::make('Email'), // Add other fields like LinkedIn URL ]; }`

##### JobPost, Resume, and CoverLetter Resources

Follow similar steps, defining fields like company name, job title for JobPost, and file paths for Resume and CoverLetter. For example, JobPost:

php

CollapseWrapCopy

`public function fields(Request $request) { return [ ID::make()->sortable(), BelongsTo::make('User'), Text::make('Company Name'), Text::make('Job Title'), Textarea::make('Job Description'), ]; }`

#### Implement Generation Logic: Core Functionality

The heart of HireGlue is generating tailored resumes and cover letters, using OpenAI for content and Dompdf for PDFs.

##### Setting Up OpenAI Integration

Install the SDK:

bash

CollapseWrapCopy

`composer require openai-php/client`

Configure the API key in .env:

text

CollapseWrapCopy

`OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

Create an OpenAIService class, e.g.:

php

CollapseWrapCopy

`namespace App\Services; use OpenAI; class OpenAIService { protected $client; public function __construct() { $this->client = OpenAI::client(env('OPENAI_API_KEY')); } public function createAssistant($name, $instructions) { return $this->client->assistants()->create([ 'name' => $name, 'instructions' => $instructions, 'model' => 'gpt-4', ]); } }`

##### Resume and CoverLetter Generators

Create generators, e.g., ResumeGenerator:

php

CollapseWrapCopy

`namespace App\Generators; use App\Models\JobPost; use App\Models\User; use App\Services\OpenAIService; class ResumeGenerator { protected $openAIService; public function __construct(OpenAIService $openAIService) { $this->openAIService = $openAIService; } public function generate(User $user, JobPost $jobPost) { // Create or get assistant with rules // Create thread, add message with user and job details // Run assistant, retrieve content // Generate PDF using Dompdf, save path } }`

Use Dompdf for PDFs:

php

CollapseWrapCopy

`use Dompdf\Dompdf; $dompdf = new Dompdf(); $dompdf->loadHtml($html); $dompdf->render(); $filePath = storage_path('app/public/resumes/resume_' . $jobPost->id . '.pdf'); file_put_contents($filePath, $dompdf->output());`

##### Rule Implementation

Rules are incorporated into assistant instructions, e.g., for resumes:

*   "Use single-column format, no typos, include LinkedIn link, 475-600 words, measurable results, no buzzwords." Validation can be added post-generation, checking word count and keywords, with regeneration if needed.

#### Additional Considerations

Design HTML templates using Blade, e.g., resources/views/resume.blade.php, with placeholders for dynamic content. Test with sample job posts, refining prompts based on output quality. For MVP, focus on functionality, with future iterations for UI polish and rule expansion.

This comprehensive approach ensures a fast, functional implementation within 1-2 days, aligning with your coding speed and project goals.
