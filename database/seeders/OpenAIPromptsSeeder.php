I'm a job seeker applying for a {{target_role}} in {{company}}

I will share the job description/content for this role.

Based on this job description, your task is to anaylze, extract, refine and format the following required information from this job posting in the exact JSON structure provided below:

1. Basic information: job title, company name, job description
2. Job details: location type, position level, job type, posted date (if available)
3. Hiring manager information (if available)
4. Recruiter names (if available)
5. Internal job codes (if available)
6. Biggest challenge: What is the biggest challenge someone in this position would face day-to-day? Give me the root cause of this issue.
7. Skills (both required and preferred). Add any additional determined skills that apply to the job position that may not have been explicity mentioned.
8. Ideal Skills: A sub-set of skill names from the overall list of skills extracted that are required to perform exceptionally well and be a rockstar canidate in this position.
9. Experience requirements
10. Education requirements
11. Salary information if available

Be thorough in your analysis. For biggest challenge, skills, ideal skills, required experience, and education, use a format compatible with our database:

For skills & ideal skills
- Each skill needs: name (Typically short and commonly used in the industry. e.g.: "Javascript" or "Front-End Development"), type (technical, soft, domain, tool, language, other), and determined proficiency level (1-10 scale) and infer/proficiency reason (How and why you inferred the skill and why you scored it that level. keep it short and concise)
- Infer skill types from context
- Set appropriate skill levels (1=Novice, 10=expert) based on job requirements following this proficiency scale:
  - 1-2 (Novice): Basic theoretical knowledge, little to no practical experience.
  - 3-4 (Beginner): Some hands-on experience, can handle simple tasks with guidance.
  - 5-6 (Intermediate): Solid working knowledge, can work independently on moderately complex tasks.
  - 7-8 (Advanced): Expert-level skills, can lead projects or solve complex problems.
  - 9-10 (Master/Expert): World-class expertise, can innovate or teach others

For experience:
- Each experience needs: title, years (as a number), level (Novice, beginner, intermediate, advanced, master, expert), and description
- Extract years from text (e.g., "3 years experience" â†’ 3)
- Infer experience level and reason (factoring in years if possible) following same proficiency scale as skills.

For education:
- Each education item needs: level (high_school, associate, bachelor, master, doctorate, certificate, other), field, is_required_strict (boolean; true if mentioned and determined that it is absolutely necessary to apply OR false if preferred but sufficient work experience can suffice), min_gpa (if mentioned), description
