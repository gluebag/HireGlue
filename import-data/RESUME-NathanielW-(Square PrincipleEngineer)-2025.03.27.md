- **Networking & Security:**  DDoS mitigation whether via Cloudflare (custom firewall rules) or a bare public-facing linux server with wireshark analysis/custom ufw rules and scripts. SSL/TLS, encryption, OWASP security practices, handling sensitive data with compliance considerations. Even wrote a end-to-end encrypted messaging mobile app years ago that is very similar to Signal and the encryption methods they use.


- **Communication Platforms:**  SMS gateways (Twilio API integration, SMPP, even have done local-hardware implementations like physical LTE modules and raspberry pis, scaling them into full production hardware with custom PCBs designed and manufactured), email delivery (SMTP, AWS SES), push notifications; built custom communication pipelines and audience segmentation tools.

## Cover Letter

**Dear Hiring Team at Square (Block),**
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the **Staff Software Engineer, GTM Engineering**  position at Square. With 18 years of software development experience – from launching my own startups to engineering large-scale messaging platforms – I am confident that my technical expertise and leadership skills align perfectly with the needs of your Go-To-Market Engineering team. Square’s mission to empower businesses resonates strongly with me. Throughout my career, I have built tools that help organizations communicate with and serve their customers, which is exactly the focus of this role.
In my previous role as Founder and CTO of Attentiv Development, I designed and built a **telecom/SMS communications platform**  from scratch. This system is very similar in spirit to what Square’s GTM Engineering team oversees. I worked end-to-end on that platform: implementing the infrastructure for **high-volume SMS and email outreach** , ensuring messages were delivered reliably and on time, and scaling the architecture to support millions of monthly interactions. I also developed features for **audience segmentation and real-time analytics** , giving product and marketing teams the ability to target users and measure campaign performance. This experience required a relentless focus on **operational excellence**  – I had to guarantee fault-tolerant performance (even under DDoS attacks and traffic surges) without compromising on speed or user experience. The result was a robust system that allowed our clients to reach their customers seamlessly across channels, much like Square enables its merchants to do.
Beyond my hands-on coding abilities, I bring significant **technical leadership**  experience. I have led small engineering teams, mentoring developers and instituting best practices in code quality, security, and agile delivery. For example, I’ve guided junior engineers in breaking down complex projects into manageable milestones – a skill directly relevant to a Staff Engineer’s role in driving initiatives and helping others succeed. My background as a startup founder means I am very comfortable collaborating cross-functionally. I frequently interfaced with sales, marketing, and support departments to align technology solutions with business strategy. I learned to approach problems with high empathy for end-users and non-technical stakeholders, translating their needs into simple and effective workflows. This holistic perspective would enable me to contribute meaningfully to Square’s go-to-market strategy, working closely with diverse teams to achieve shared goals.

I am particularly excited by the technologies and scale at which Square operates. While my core expertise is in Python, PHP, and Go, I am a quick study and have dabbled in Java and Kubernetes. I thrive on learning new tech stacks – in fact, picking up Kotlin or Ruby on Rails (as mentioned in your job description) is a challenge I welcome. My extensive experience with messaging protocols (SMS, email) and APIs like Twilio means I can hit the ground running on communications infrastructure projects. Additionally, as someone who values security and compliance, I am impressed by Square’s commitment to protecting customer data, and I am eager to uphold those high standards.


After years of entrepreneurial work, I am looking for a long-term role at a company where I can make a significant impact and continue to grow. Square’s culture of innovation and its track record of supporting small businesses make it an ideal fit for my next career chapter. I am also drawn to the stability and collaborative environment of a larger organization. It would allow me to focus on what I do best – building great software – while contributing to a team and mission I believe in. As a husband and father, finding a stable yet stimulating position is important to me, and I know that Square provides an environment where engineers can thrive and innovate for the long haul.


Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of bringing my skills to Square’s GTM Engineering team. I am confident I can help drive its communication platforms to new heights, and would love the opportunity to discuss in more detail how my background can benefit your team. Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

**Nathaniel Williams**
