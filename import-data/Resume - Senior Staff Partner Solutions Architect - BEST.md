**Objective**
Seasoned and versatile software engineer with 18 years of experience, eager to fill any gaps and drive innovation as a Senior Staff Partner Solutions Architect at Google Cloud. Proven in designing scalable web-based platforms that are unique to their industry. I bring technical expertise and a collaborative team spirit to be what I think would be the "perfect puzzle piece" Google is looking for in a hire for this role. I am ready to commute to Google's Brickell office most days to collaborate in-person, but I also have honed-in discipline and flexibility for remote work and can adapt to any situation.
