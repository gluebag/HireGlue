**Hiring Manager**
Google Cloud
Miami, FL

**Dear Hiring Manager**,

I’m thrilled to apply for the Senior Staff Partner Solutions Architect role at Google Cloud. With 18 years of hands-on experience, I live for designing and coding beautiful, scalable systems—like my telecom/SMS platform that delighted clients with millions of flawless interactions. I love mapping out every detail before typing the first line of code, ensuring an elegant solution every time.

I’m drawn to this role as an individual contributor, where I can focus on technical excellence without the immediate leap to managing a team. As a busy family man with rental properties and other commitments, I want to avoid burnout and grow into leadership later. I’m based 55 minutes from Brickell and would love to collaborate in-office most days—face-to-face sparks my best work. Travel up to 30%? No problem.

**What challenges could I solve for your team?** I’d be excited to chat about it. Targeting $227K+ base, I’m flexible on bonuses or a fast start (1-2 weeks).



**Thanks for your time**,
