Hiring Manager  
Google Cloud  
Miami, FL *(maybe?)*

**Dear Hiring Manager**,

I’m thrilled to apply for the Senior Staff Partner Solutions Architect role at Google Cloud. With 18 years of software engineering experience, including founding Attentiv Development and scaling a telecom platform to millions of interactions, I’m ready to bring my technical and leadership skills to your team.

At Attentiv, I architected fault-tolerant systems, led cross-functional efforts, and delivered innovative solutions—mirroring the co-innovation and technical expertise this role demands. As a family man, I embrace Googleyness through kindness and teamwork, eager to fill any gaps your team faces.

What challenges are you tackling, and what does your ideal candidate bring? I’m confident my adaptability and proven impact ($7.4M revenue peak) can help. I target $227K+ base, negotiable with a sign-on bonus or 1–2 week start, but I’m flexible if that’s not feasible.

Thank you for your time—I’d love to discuss how I can contribute!

Sincerely,  
Nathaniel Williams
